# Supervised Learning - Developer Notes

## Introduction

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The algorithm learns the relationship between input features and target outputs.

### Hinglish Explanation
Supervised learning ek machine learning technique hai jismein models labeled training data se learn karte hain aur new, unseen data pe predictions karte hain. Algorithm input features aur target outputs ke beech relationship seekhta hai.
